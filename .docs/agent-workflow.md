# Agent workflow — version 2.0.0

Every behavior change requires this pipeline: orchestrator defines expected
behavior; spec writer writes tests; runner demonstrates the expected failure;
reviewer accepts the tests before implementation; implementer changes code;
runner verifies green; reviewer independently checks implementation and final
diff. Repeat findings through the responsible role. The orchestrator coordinates
delegation as a workflow responsibility, not a hook permission restriction.

Claude subagents cannot start other subagents, so in Claude Code the
main session acts as orchestrator: it delegates each step to the workflow-*
agents and makes no source or test edits itself. Codex may use
workflow_orchestrator directly.

Accepted tests are the contract. Never weaken an accepted test to accommodate
an implementation defect. Changes to expected behavior require a test-writer
revision and renewed reviewer acceptance. New regression tests are permitted.
Record hashes of accepted tests before implementation and compare afterward.

## Scope and roles

- Spec writer owns edits to matched tests and test fixtures.
- Implementer owns edits to matched source files, excluding matched tests.
- Runner, reviewer, orchestrator and parent sessions do not edit source or tests.
- All roles may edit unscoped files, including documentation and artifacts.
- Commands, inspection, Git operations, MCP tools and coordination are outside
  this hook's restrictions. Native permissions and user authorization still apply.

Tests take precedence when a path matches both lists. Repository-relative source
patterns identify code extensions and named build files, rather than every file
in a source directory. The policy copies live at `.codex/hooks/policy.json` and
`.claude/hooks/policy.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "source_globs": [
    "lib/*.ex",
    "lib/*.exs",
    "lib/*.heex",
    "lib/*.eex",
    "lib/*.leex",
    "config/*.exs",
    "mix.exs",
    "mix.lock",
    ".formatter.exs",
    ".credo.exs",
    "assets/js/*.js",
    "assets/js/*.mjs",
    "assets/js/*.ts",
    "assets/js/*.tsx",
    "assets/css/*.css",
    "assets/css/*.scss",
    "assets/vendor/*.js",
    "assets/vendor/*.ts",
    "assets/package.json",
    "assets/package-lock.json",
    "assets/tsconfig.json",
    "assets/vitest.config.mts",
    "priv/repo/*.exs",
    "rel/overlays/bin/server",
    "rel/overlays/bin/server.bat",
    "rel/overlays/bin/migrate",
    "rel/overlays/bin/migrate.bat",
    "infra/*.tf",
    "infra/*.hcl",
    "infra/*.yaml",
    "infra/*.yml",
    "deploy/*.sh",
    "deploy/*.yaml",
    "deploy/*.yml",
    "deploy/*.tmpl",
    "deploy/Caddyfile",
    "Dockerfile",
    ".github/workflows/*.yml",
    ".github/workflows/*.yaml",
    "priv/demo/*.py",
    "priv/demo/*.sh"
  ],
  "test_globs": [
    "test/**",
    "**/*_test.py",
    "**/*.test.js",
    "**/*.test.ts",
    "**/*.spec.js",
    "**/*.spec.ts"
  ]
}
```

There is no additional enforcement-file exception. Agent instructions, hook
configuration, data, docs and artifacts are not automatically classified as
source. Existing repository privacy, deployment and domain guidance still applies.
Recommended test commands in repository documentation are guidance, not a command
allowlist. The runner records the authoritative red/green evidence; this role
assignment does not make command execution a special permission.

## Enforcement boundary

The guard checks direct Codex apply_patch edits and Claude Write, Edit and
NotebookEdit operations. It checks all operands of add, update, delete and move.
Native host agent_id and agent_type identify roles; a prompt claim does not.
Allowed or unrelated calls return an empty object and leave native approvals
unchanged. The hook only emits explicit denials for invalid or forbidden direct
edits. Native sandbox and permission settings remain in control of other actions.

Shell commands and MCP tools can modify files without direct-edit interception.
This deliberately narrow hook is not complete filesystem confinement. Do not
use another route to evade the source/test ownership workflow. Review final
diffs and accepted-test hashes, including changes made by formatters, Git hooks,
snapshot updates and other commands. Accidental native hook failure is an
explicitly accepted limitation. There is no separate Git delivery prohibition.

## Bash audit log

Claude Bash calls are audited, not blocked. Before each call the audit hook
snapshots changed and untracked files; afterwards it compares. When any file
changed, it appends one JSON line to `.agent-audit/bash.jsonl` with the command,
session, agent id, agent type, role (`main` for the parent session), outcome,
HEAD before and after, each changed path with its class, and `violations` for
source or test changes by a role that does not own them. Source and test entries
carry a unified diff capped at 200 lines; other files list only the path, so
secrets in unscoped files never enter the log. Ignored files are not audited.
Calls that overlap in time are listed, since their changes cannot be separated.
Commit the log with the work. `.gitattributes` uses union merge for it. Reviewers
check `violations` before accepting. Codex shell calls are not audited.

## Platform setup and activation

Codex definitions are in .codex/agents and its hook registration is in
.codex/hooks.json. Review exact new definitions through /hooks when required.
Claude definitions are in .claude/agents and its registration is in
.claude/settings.json. This setup adds no Claude tool allowlists, broad Edit
denials or sandbox overrides. Existing unrelated native settings and hooks are
preserved. No model is selected. Codex roles are workflow_spec_writer,
workflow_implementer, workflow_runner, workflow_reviewer and
workflow_orchestrator; Claude role names use hyphens.

Existing legacy role files remain for reference. Use the workflow roles for
source/test work; an unrecognized identity cannot edit either class. Existing
native protections may independently limit configuration files or other actions.
Codex CLI, Claude Code and desktop require separate native validation. Installing
files does not establish hook trust or runtime validation.

The workflow manifest records generated bytes. Reinstall from the maintained
setup after review and compare hashes for drift. Preserve repository-specific
instructions outside the bounded generated sections.
